0,"You have been offereda job such as handover to a stronger cells or adding a new Carrier Component (CC) in the case of Carrier Aggression, it is required to measure the serving cell and neighbor cell signal strength or signal quality matrix i.e. RSRP or RSRQ. This requirement enables the measurement process to be executed appropriately, maintaining the radio link quality. In LTE, all eNodeBs continually transmits Cell-specific Reference Signal (CRS), so it is easy for the mobile device to measure the cell quality of neighboring cells. However in 5G NR, there is the concept of CRS has be removed to reduce the overhead and Reference Signal interference from other cells.","You have been offered a job"
1,"You must report at the location measurement by using SS/PBCH Block (SSB), which is composed of Synchronizations Signal (SS) and Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) having longer transmission periodicity than CRS. The number of SSB in one burst depend on the Operating frequency. If Operating frequency (fc) is < 3GHz (FR1) the no. of SSB is 4, for  fc = 3GHz to 6 GHz (FR1) no. of SSB  is 8 and for fc >6 GHz mm-wave no. of SSB is be 64 within one burst.","You must report at the location"
